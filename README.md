# Calculate discount
The program calculates the final price after applying a discount

## How the program works
The function `calculate_discount()` calculates the final price with a discount if discount is greater than 20%.

The function `validate_user_inputs()` validates the price and discount inputs entered by user. \
If there is an invalid input, the functions returs an error message and user is prompted to enter inputs again.
